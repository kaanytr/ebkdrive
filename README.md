An open-source sensored BLDC controller board that integrates all necessary components into a compact form factor which is 65x65mm. The controller integrates STM32 blackpill as microcontroller. The converter that steps down a 36V battery input to 5V for powering the microcontroller and a step-up converter that boosts the 5V to 12V in order to supply the gate driver ICs.
